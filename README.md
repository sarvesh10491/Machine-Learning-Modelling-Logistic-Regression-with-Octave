# Machine-Learning-Modelling-Logistic-Regression-with-Octave

Exercise case from Stanford machine learning course dataset

Logistic Regression without Regularization :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this part of the exercise, you will build a logistic regression model to predict whether a student gets admitted into a university.
Suppose that you are the administrator of a university department 
and you want to determine each applicant's chance of admission based on their results on two exams. 
You have historical data from previous applicants that you can use as a training set for logistic regression. 
For each training example, you have the applicant's scores on two exams and the admissions decision.
Your task is to build a classification model that estimates an applicant's probability of admission based the scores from those two exams.


Logistic Regression with Regularization :
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this part of the exercise, you will implement regularized logistic regression 
to predict whether microchips from a fabrication plant passes quality assurance (QA). 
During QA, each microchip goes through various tests to ensure it is functioning correctly.
Suppose you are the product manager of the factory and you have the test results for some microchips on two different tests. 
From these two tests, you would like to determine whether the microchips should be accepted or rejected. 
To help you make the decision, you have a dataset of test results on past microchips, from which you can build a logistic regression model.
